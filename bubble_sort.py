# Bubble Sort Algorithm Construction Instructions

# 1. Terry: Define the bubbleSort function and accept an array as an argument.
# 2. Ellie: Initialize a flag called 'swapped' to True before entering the while loop.
# 3. Callum: Create a while loop that runs as long as 'swapped' is True.
# 4. Cia: Inside the while loop, set 'swapped' to False at the beginning of each iteration.
# 5. James: Use a for loop to iterate through the array, starting from index 1 to the end of the array.
# 6. Jake: In the for loop, check if the current element is less than the previous element.
# 7. Dan S: If the condition is true, swap the two elements.
# 8. Matty: Set 'swapped' to True after a swap has occurred.
# 9. Dan M: After implementing the bubble sort logic, create an example list to test your function.
# 10. Ryan: Call the bubbleSort function with the example list.
# 11. Edwards: Print the sorted list after calling the bubbleSort function.

# Bonus Task: After all the tasks are complete, implement unit tests to verify that the bubbleSort function works as expected.
